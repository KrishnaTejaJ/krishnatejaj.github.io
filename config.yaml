        I am a Master's student in Data Science at Indiana University Bloomington. With a background in software development and a passion for artificial intelligence, I'm driven to build data-driven solutions that bring insights and innovation to real-world problems.

        My experience ranges from developing an inclusive AI hiring tool at Omdena to programming healthcare applications at Tata Consultancy Services. I thrive on hands-on projects, having contributed to research on skin lesion analysis and explored techniques like recommendation systems and audio sentiment analysis.

        I'm well-versed in Python and a suite of data science libraries (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, etc.). Outside of my studies, you might find me competing in hackathons or experimenting with data visualization tools.
